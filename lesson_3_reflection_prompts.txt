When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would need to set the remote repo within the project
    e.g.: git remote add origin git@github.com:rexminnis/reflections.git

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manually keep the local up to date allows to developer to controll the process and
    to only accept changes that are desired.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Git fork - is a GitHub concept that allow another person to clone another
               publicly available GitHub repo on GitHub.

    Git clone - allow you to copy a repo remote or local

    Git branch - allow you to copy a local snapshot of a repo

  If I am working on feature set for a code base that is already in Production,
  I would clone the master repo, then create a branch of it then work on that
  branch.   

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

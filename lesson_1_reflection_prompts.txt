How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Doing a diff show which lines changed in the file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It can be good to have version as automatic version after a saved

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Make it earlier to use.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you have the option of rolling backup.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    versioning this file

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It may be easier for the system to track a single file change.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You can you the git log to obtain a summary view of the change log and use git diff

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
